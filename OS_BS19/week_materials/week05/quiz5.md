#### Task 6

What is the purpose of ```exec()``` system call? Select one:
- ```To execute a program specified by input parameters in a new process```
- ```To stop execution of a process specified by input parameters```
- ```To create a copy of the currently running process```

#### Task 7

An operating system component, responsible for changing processes states and planning processor time is called

Select one:
- ```Process manager```
- ```Scheduler``` <- **Correct**
- ```IPC```
- ```Kernel```

> In computing, scheduling is the method by which work is assigned to resources that complete the work. The work may be virtual computation elements such as threads, processes or data flows, which are in turn scheduled onto hardware resources such as processors, network links or expansion cards.

- ```Multiple processes can belong to the same thread```
- ```Multiple threads can belong to the same process``` <- **Correct**
- ```Multiple threads can share the same address space without any explicit action from the developer ``` <- **Correct**
- ```Multiple processes can share the same address space without any explicit action from the developer```
