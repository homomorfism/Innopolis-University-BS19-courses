#### Task 1

Five jobs are waiting to be run. Their expected run times are ```9, 6, 3, 5, and X```. In what order should they be run to minimize average response time if ```X > 9```?
Select one:
- ```X, 9, 6, 5, 3```
- ```3, 5, 6, 9, X``` <- **Correct**
- ```9, 6, 5, 3, X```
- ```X, 3, 5, 6, 9```

In ```3, 5, 6, 9, X``` we wait less for executing programs -> it is correct answer (may be prof. meant that we use SJF or similar algo).

#### Task 2

Five batch jobs A through E, arrive at a computer center at almost the same time. They have estimated running times of 10, 6, 4, 2, and 8 minutes. Their (externally determined) priorities are 5, 2, 3, 1, and 4, respectively, with 5 being the highest priority. For the Priority scheduling algorithm, determine the mean process turnaround time. Ignore process switching overhead. Assume that the system is multiprogramming, and that each job gets its fair share of the CPU.
Select one:
- ```21.2```
- ```18```
- ```22```
- ```20```
- ```21.6 ``` <- **Correct**

Add please calculations!!!
